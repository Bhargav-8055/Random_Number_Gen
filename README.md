# Random_Number_Gen
Here I Built a Random Number Generator Using Html, Css and Javascript. This is one of the tiny Project I made when I was Learning Javascript 
Here in the application it consists of two Buttons:
1. Generating Random Number between 1-100
2. Restart - Which Displays Nothing, the circular part would be empty

By pressing the Generate button we can see a Random Number between 1-100 in the circle
